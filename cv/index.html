        <p>With my extensive experience in content creation, developer relations, community management, and technical program management, as well as my proficiency in various open-source technologies, I am confident that I would be an excellent fit for this role.<br><br>
          Most recently, over the past two years as a Senior Staff Developer Advocate at Qualcomm, I have led and executed open-source engagement initiatives that connect cutting-edge semiconductor technology with real-world developer needs. In this role, I organized and hosted hackathons and workshops to support product launches, collaborated directly with upstream kernel maintainers, and actively contributed to major open-source projects. I worked closely with engineering, product, and marketing teams to align developer initiatives with business goals, while also mentoring new hires and interns on open-source practices and community engagement. A key focus of my work has been developing and communicating novel AI-at-the-edge use cases, translating complex technical concepts into clear, compelling content for both technical and non-technical audiences.<br><br>
          As a Developer Advocate at Temporal, my main responsibility was to help the developer community do better work faster and more efficiently. In this role, I was responsible for creating technical content, managing social media channels, driving developer engagement through public speaking engagements, and building relationships with key stakeholders.<br><br>
          Before Temporal, I worked as a Technical Evangelist at Cockroach Labs. I created and executed technical content strategies, managed social media channels, and drove developer engagement through public speaking engagements. Additionally, as a Developer Advocate at Equinix Metal, I managed the company's developer relations program, drove the adoption of the company's IaaS solutions, and increased developer engagement through public speaking events and online communities.<br><br>
          My experience at Red Hat, where I worked in various technical roles, has given me a deep understanding of open-source technologies such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, OpenStack, Ansible, Python, and Git, as well as experience in DevOps, containers, and cloud services. As a Technical Program Manager, I led cross-functional teams to deliver complex technical projects, while as a Software Engineer, I worked on developing solutions for various customer requirements. Additionally, as a Technical Account Manager and Technical Support Engineer, I managed customer relationships, provided technical support, and ensured customer satisfaction.<br><br>
          I am excited to bring my technical expertise, community management, and developer relations experience to your company and contribute to its growth and success. <br><br>
          Thank you for your time and consideration.<br><br>
          All the best,<br>
          Rain</p>
